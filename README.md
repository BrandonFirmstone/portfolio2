# Project Summary
<strong>Dungeon Crawler</strong> is a website for hosting a collection of text-based adventure games using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Each individual game may have different styles, mechanics, stories and genres. The idea of this project is to test the efficacy of creating a text-based game library with the goal of generating revenue. 
The long-term plan for Dungeon Crawler is to have recurring subscriptions to access the full library of games. Users can signup to play the free games, but must have a premium account to play the full library. 

# Project Design
The design of the website should be quite simplistic, to reflect the games hosted. That being said, it should be styled so that it fits in with the theme of 'Dungeon Crawler' and adventure games in general. That being said, below are the design consideration took into account when making this website.

## Project Goals
The project goals are as follows:
- Create a website structure that allows for adding multiple different JavaScript text-based games
- Add an adventure game to the site, that works completely and is an enjoyable experience
- Consider in business-terms the efficacy of increasing the scale of this concept website.

## UX Design
User experience design is of utmost importance in this project. Ensuring that the user can easily navigate the site, interact with the different games and has a positive experience makes it far more likely that the user will sign up for premium services. Below are UX Design considerations that have been taken into account.

### Strategy
#### Audience
The audience is old-school gamers and current adventure enthusiasts. Games such as Dungeons and Dragons are still vastly popular, so tapping into this market would be ideal. Enthusiasts and casual gamers are still interested in text-based games, as games such as AI Dungeon have massively swept social media and YouTube.

### Scope
The project deadline is 12/08/2021. In order to keep the scope down, the user system will not be implemented. Only one game will be developed for the library. The website will be a basic demonstration of what it will become. 

### Structure
The website will be structured to display a selection of the games available in the library. It will also link to the library in a call-to-action. The library will be in a tile format, with a thumbnail for each game, a short description underneath and a link to play the game. Each game can have different structures, but the game that will be made for demonstration purposes will be inside of a bordered div, with the text at the top, buttons underneath the text and different icons underneath representing different attributes to be linked to the player (for example, armour, weapons etc) and a health bar. Each game will have it's own directory, in order to keep them separated in a logical and tidy manner.

# Development



## README Purpose
The README is used in order to convey to the reader the purpose of this website and how it has been developed. Future developers that may work on this site as well as myself can refer to this document to find information regarding the website's current development stage, any bugs and issues found and more. It also means that future developers can keep to the same styles and keep the website consistent.

## Site Structure



## Naming Conventions
The naming conventions for each file within the repository is using lower-case characters and hyphens to separate the words. Classes and IDs in HTML will use this same format. Variables and other names in JavaScript will use camel case (Capitalizing the first letter of each word bar the first word. For example, camelCaseHere.) 


## Languages Used
The languages used for this website are as follows:
- HTML for the structure of the pages
- CSS for styling the pages
- JavaScript for interactivity and functionality (As well as the games on the site)

## Tools Used
For the development of this site, the following tools have been used:
- GitHub for version control and storing the in-development site
- GitPod for writing the code on the website
- Balsamiq Wireframes used to draw the wireframes that the website has been based on.
