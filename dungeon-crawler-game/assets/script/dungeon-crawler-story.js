 * Each text node has an ID, text and options.
 * Each option has text to describe itself as well as a nextText value to declare what text node should be shown next
 * The options can also have a setState value, adding any attributes required to the player.
 * It can also have a requiredState value, showing that the option can't be selected unless this condition is met.
 * The healthValue is how much the player's health bar should be changed. If the player loses health, it's a negative number.
