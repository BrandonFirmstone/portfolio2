  * The concepts in this javascript file came from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1S_NhKkvGA&t=119s.
  * I adapted the story for my own and put the textNodes into story.js so it's easier to update.
  * I added healthValues to the options so I can keep track of a characterâ€™s health as they progress. 
  * This allows them to die due based on their choices through the story not due to just one decision.
